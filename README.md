So this is a full-stack web application that allows you to search by neighborhood and businesses within the Los Angeles County to find safety ratings. Our neighborhood safety information is provided by an FBI database and some real-estate API information. Our business safety information is provided primarily by a user-input generated database from a local survey on our app.

The __*safety rating data*__ is generated by:
* crimes in the neighborhood searched
* user rating scores based on specific business locations



__*Our Team*__:
* Carrie Wiener 
* John Belciglio 
* Michael Reza Sanaiha 
* Pauline-ann Bantayan 
* Kevin Yang 

For more information, please check our About, Safety Rating, and Disclaimer - they have information regarding formulas used for scoring the Safety Ratings.

### This app is meant to help women navigate their social outtings in Los Angeles! Have fun, be safe, and let lightHouse shine the way!
